Recent advancements in foundation models have enabled unprecedented progress in robotics.
Leveraging learning-based approaches, the community has produced the first generalist models for tasks such as manipulation and whole-body control, with many results openly released.
This work presents a comprehensive tutorial on modern robot learning, introducing the conceptual underpinnings of the most prominent approaches and pairing them with reproducible implementations using the open-source LeRobot framework.
The tutorial is designed to serve both as a structured academic reference and as a practical guide for researchers in the field of robot learning.
