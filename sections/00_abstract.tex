Recent advancements in foundation models have enabled unprecedented progress in robotics, particularly in the development of increasingly more capable generalist robotics models.
Leveraging modern learning-based approaches, the robotics community produced the first general models for tasks including locomotion and manipulation, and many said results have been openly released to the open-source community.
This manuscript presents a comprehensive tutorial on the premises and techiniques common for modern robot learning, introducing the conceptual underpinnings of the most prominent approaches and pairing them with reproducible implementations using \texttt{lerobot}, the open-source robotics library developed by Hugging Face.
The tutorial is designed to serve as a self-contained, structured reference for robotics practictioners working with LeRobot, and as a practical guide for researchers in the field of robot learning.
