Recent advancements in foundation models have enabled unprecedented progress in robotics, particularly in the development of increasingly more capable generalist robotics models.
Leveraging modern learning-based approaches, the robotics community produced the first general models for tasks including locomotion and manipulation, and many said results have been openly released to the open-source community.
The premise of generalist models is to learn control strategies across tasks and different robot embodiments, a long-standing challenge in robot learning.
This work aims at being a tutorial on the most common techniques used for modern robot learning, covering both the conceptual underpinnings of the most prominent approaches, and pairing them with reproducible implementations using \lerobot \ (\url{https://github.com/huggingface/lerobot}), the full-stack open-source robotics library developed by Hugging Face.
This tutorial is designed to serve as a self-contained, structured reference for robotics practictioners working with \lerobot, as well as a practical guide for researchers in the field of robot learning.
